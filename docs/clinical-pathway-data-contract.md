# Clinical Pathway Data Contract

This document is the canonical contract for Clinical Pathway, Claim Validation, Fees & Drugs, scoring, AI usage, API docs, and result UI.

## 1. Canonical input only

The product is not released yet, so consumers and producers must use one canonical shape. Do not add or preserve legacy duplicate keys.

### Procedure

```ts
{
  code?: string | null;
  name: string;
  category?: string;
  quantity: number;
  unitPrice: number;
  totalPrice: number;
}
```

Forbidden aliases: `procedureName`, `description`, `price`, `claimedUnitPrice`, `claimedTotal`, `claimedPrice`, `procedureCode`, `serviceCode`.

### Medication / Farmalkes

```ts
{
  code?: string | null;
  name: string;
  genericName?: string;
  dosage?: string;
  quantity: number;
  unitPrice: number;
  totalPrice: number;
  frequency?: string;
  duration?: string;
}
```

Forbidden aliases: `medicationName`, `price`, `claimedUnitPrice`, `claimedTotal`, `drugName`, `drugGenericName`.

### Diagnosis

```ts
{
  code: string;
  name: string;
  type: 'PRIMARY' | 'SECONDARY' | 'COMPLICATION';
  sequence: number;
}
```

`description` is not an input alias for diagnosis name.

## 2. Producers and consumers

Keep these files aligned whenever the contract changes:

- `src/lib/ai/types.ts`
- `src/app/dashboard/clinical-pathway/components/PathwayWizard.tsx`
- `src/app/dashboard/clinical-pathway/components/PathwayImportModal.tsx`
- `src/app/dashboard/clinical-pathway/components/PathwayResultViewer.tsx`
- `src/app/api/v1/claims/map-json/route.ts`
- `src/lib/ai/drivers/openai-compatible.ts`
- `src/lib/ai/validators/tariff.ts`
- `src/lib/ai/validators/drug-price.ts`
- `src/workflows/claim-validation/steps.ts`
- `public/swagger.json`
- sample payloads under `sample-data/clinical-pathway-score-demo/`

## 3. Tariff validation

Tariff validation uses local master fee schedule data only.

Resolution order:
1. If `procedure.code` is provided, match active tariff by exact `procedureCode` or `serviceCode` for the selected provider.
2. If code is absent, match exact procedure name against the provider's active master tariff.
3. If no match is found, emit `NOT_FOUND` and let scoring count it under master-data readiness.

Price fields:
- claimed unit price = `unitPrice`
- claimed total = `totalPrice` or `unitPrice * quantity` if total is omitted internally
- expected total = master max price × quantity

## 4. Medication / Farmalkes validation

Medication pricing must use local `MedicalItemPriceMaster` / master Farmalkes rows.

AI is allowed only as a local master-data matcher/resolver:
- input: claimed medication, diagnosis context, and local candidates
- output: selected local candidate id + confidence + reason
- AI must not estimate prices, search the internet, invent products, or provide market prices

Reference price selection uses the best meaningful local value:
1. `maxReferencePrice`
2. `hetPrice`
3. `marketPriceMax`
4. `fixPrice`

A meaningful price is `>= 100`.

## 5. Diagnosis validation behavior

Diagnosis-treatment validation must support multiple diagnoses in one claim episode:
- output includes one validation detail per claimed diagnosis
- procedure and medication review uses the full episode context, including primary, secondary, and complication diagnoses
- a procedure/medication should not be counted as an episode-level clinical mismatch if it is appropriate for at least one diagnosis in the episode
- clinical pathway generation uses the primary diagnosis as the pathway driver while secondary/complication diagnoses inform monitoring, supportive care, risk review, and discharge criteria

## 6. Scoring

Scoring starts at 100 and deducts proportionally by validation aspect.

Master-data readiness must be fair:
- total master-data denominator = number of claimed procedures + claimed medications
- missing ratio = missing procedure references + missing medication references / denominator
- deduction = master-data weight × missing ratio

Do not deduct the full master-data readiness weight for a single missing item unless it is the only procedure/medication item.

Items without master references are not mixed into price-compliance deductions. They are counted under master-data readiness.

## 7. LOS behavior

LOS validation compares actual LOS from encounter dates with expected LOS from the pathway/LOS estimator. LOS is a separate scoring dimension and only deducts when actual LOS exceeds the expected standard beyond configured tolerance.

## 8. Timeline behavior

Result UI should group pathway phases by canonical phase/day fields from pathway output. Do not infer grouping from provider-specific labels.

## 9. Safe-change checklist

Before changing this contract:
1. Update all producers/consumers listed above.
2. Update API docs and samples.
3. Run `npx prisma generate` if schema/client types changed.
4. Run `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty false`.
5. Run `npm run build`.
